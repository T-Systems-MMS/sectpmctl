Description: sectpmctl - Secure Boot and TPM backed LUKS full disc encryption
 The default of most Linux distributions is to use a password and eventually
 a recovery key to decrypt the encrypted root partition of a drive. sectpmctl
 stores the LUKS key inside the TPM and only releases it if the system is in
 a defined state when booting. To not have to fight with the so called PCR
 brittleness of the TPM on boot and system measurements, it implements
 Secure Boot with decentralized keys to keep the system in the required
 state. This results in zero administrative overhead for the TPM in case of
 system updates.
